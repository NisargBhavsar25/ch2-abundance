GPU can be used only for calculation of solid angle calculation 

if we calculate solid angle interaction for an energy level once, we dont need to do it again
doesnt depend on filename or newfile, it depends only on the energy
adding new elements doesnt need solid angle calculation but needs escape peak ratios calculation (a lot of time) - 7mins
only change in weight fractions(this includes obviously adding more elements) will increase the escape peak ratios calulations time
lower threads == higher time

'n_photons_interval', 'n_photons_line' changing these reduced the simulation time from 20s to 5s

times: simulation ~ 2-3s, new energy ~ 2m, new element ~ 7m,  it is done only for new thing added
the energy and element are stored in .local/share/XMI-MSIM
