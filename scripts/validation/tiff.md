# Extracting and decoding the elemental abundance information from the TIFF images


The function is designed to retrieve and decode elemental abundance values based on RGBA data from TIFF images, using a colormap (viridis) to map pixel values to scalar quantities for specific elements at given latitude and longitude coordinates. The `decode_viridis` function converts RGBA values into scalar values by finding the closest match to the viridis colormap. The `get_abundance` function takes latitude and longitude as inputs, and for each TIFF file in the specified directory (`data_path`), it calculates the corresponding pixel indices in the image based on the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). It then extracts the RGBA value at the calculated pixel location and decodes it into a scalar value using the `decode_viridis` function. The scalar value is adjusted according to the element (e.g., multiplying by scaling factors for specific elements like magnesium or iron) and stored in a dictionary. The goal of this code is to return a dictionary of decoded abundance values for each element at the specified geographic location. We are trying to achieve the task of extracting and decoding the elemental abundance information from the TIFF images based on their geographical coordinates, with appropriate scaling for each element.
