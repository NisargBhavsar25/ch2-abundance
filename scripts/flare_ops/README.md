# Solar Spectrum Analysis Script

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing solar spectrum data. The script leverages the `xspec` module to generate models and perform various analyses related to solar spectrum data. Below is a detailed explanation of the different segments of the script.

---

## **Segment 1: Importing Modules**

The script begins with importing the required modules, including `xspec`.  
The `xspec` module is crucial as it provides the functionalities necessary for modeling and generating the `.pha` text files used in the analysis.

## **Segment 2: `process_spectrum` Function**

### **Parameters**
- **Date**: Specifies the date for which data is required.
- **Level 1 Data**: Indicates the .raw file that is being used by us

### **Workflow**
1. **Start and End Time Calculation**: 
   - Either calculated as the difference between dates or provided directly by the user.
2. **Data Loading**:
   - Various factors are loaded and utilized along with time as parameters.
3. **Command Generation**: 
   - A command (`genspec_COMMAND`) is generated to process the spectrum.
4. **File Saving**: 
   - The resulting `.pha` file is saved in the specified path.

## **Segment 3: `model_solar` Function**

### **Workflow**
1. **Model Setup**:
   - Configures the solar model using the `vvpec + c*table` function.
   - Average solar flare abundance values are initialized.
2. **Background Files**:
   - Considers effects of specific elements during solar flares, which can influence the data.
3. **Spectrum Loading**:
   - Spectrum data is loaded into a `Spectrum` object and plotted.
4. **Model Creation**:
   - The model is created and referred to as `m1`of `vvpec + c*table` using the file tbmodels.fits
   - Hyperparameters are adjusted, with some values modified and others unfrozen, particularly for element-specific parameters.
5. **Plot and Flux Calculation**:
   - Generates spectrum plots for a specified energy range.
   - Calculates the flux using a function described in **Segment 4**.

### **Return Values**
- **`spec`**: The spectrum value.
- **`model`**: The solar model object.

### **Example Usage**
Example usage can be found in the script from lines **348 to 366**.

## **Segment 4: Auxiliary Functions**

This segment contains additional helper functions, including those required for flux calculation, by default being from 0.1 to 30.1 energy each step of 0.01, referenced in **Segment 3**.

---

## **Segment 5: File Processing Functions**

### **Functions**
1. **`process_files_in_xsm_folder`**:
   - Accepts the base folder address.
   - Iterates through the folder to generate `.pha` files.
2. **`process_spectrum_file`**:
   - Saves the processed `.pha` files into the destination folder.

### **Basic Imports**
- Includes necessary imports for handling file processing and spectrum generation.
